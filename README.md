# Thomas Jollans' dotfiles

This is where I keep some *dotfiles*, that is to say some local configuration
files for my Linux systems.

These dotfiles require some submodules, so don't forget to run

    git submodule init

## Installation

Installation scripts are in `INSTALL/`; to install the zsh files, run
`INSTALL/zsh` and so on.

## License

The help files included in zsh/help/ and the script zsh/helpfiles.pl are
